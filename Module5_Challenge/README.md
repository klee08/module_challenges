# Financial Planning with APIs and Simulations
Financial planning for emergencies and retirements
Part 1: A financial planner for emergencies. The members can use the tool to determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.
Part 2: A financial planner for retirement. The member can use the teool to forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years.
and also determine the weighting strategy between stock and bond portion to maximize the capital gain thru Monte Carlo simulation.

## Technologies
Jupyter Notebook and pandas for dataframe and Monte Carlo Simulation library for performance forecast analytic
s 
## Installation Guide
No installation required
- MarketData: Alpaca API Key and secret required to retrieve the historical market data
- Monte Carlo Simulation: MCForecastTools > MCSimulation 
- Other python libraries: pandas, load_dotenv, matplotlib, json


## Usage
This section should include screenshots, code blocks, or animations explaining how to use your project.
Emergency Fund:
- Use the savings_df.plot: visualizes the composition of the memberâ€™s portfolio
- Run if statements to evaluate the possibility of creating an emergency fund
Retirement Planning:
- Analyze the Retirement Portfolio Forecasts by running Monte Carlo Simulation with target stock/bond proportion and inverstment horizon inputs
